# SSPM-Project

Data compression by randomized algorithms. Codes in Python used in the project. Common project with https://github.com/mariecmpn/SSPM-project.git

Codes of the project:

rsvd.py: functions used for the RSVD;
rsvd_tests.ipynb: tests for the RSVD using the rsvd.py file;
rcur.py: code used for the CUR decomposition tests;
tensor_tucker.py: functions used for the Tucker decomposition;
hosvd_st-hosvd.py: tests for the HOSVD and ST_HOSVD;
twopass.py: test for the Two-Pass Sketch method;
onepass.py: test for the One-Pass Sketch method.
Images used for the tests:

image.png: image used for the HOSVD and ST-HOSVD;
image2.webp: image used for the Two-Pass and One_Pass algorithms.
Codes were made using the algorithms from the following papers and codes:

LOW-RANK TUCKER APPROXIMATION OF A TENSOR FROM STREAMING DATA, from Yiming Sun, Yang Guo, Charlene Luo, Joel Tropp, and Madeleine Udell.
FINDING STRUCTURE WITH RANDOMNESS: PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING APPROXIMATE MATRIX DECOMPOSITIONS , from Nathan Halko, Per-Gunnar Martinsson, and Joel A. Tropp.
